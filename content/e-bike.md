### background

I made an electric bike. 

a few years ago I made a gas-powered bike, but it was too loud and I was too self-conscious to use it frequently. I like electronics and cycling, so I decided to make an ebike

I had a spare bike. I purchased a 1200W motor from amazon. but pre-built e-bike batteries were took expensive, so I decided to build my own.

I bought 52 high-amp rated 18650 batteries, a 40A BMS, and some other components. following [this guide](https://www.ebikeschool.com/how-to-build-a-diy-electric-bicycle-lithium-battery-from-18650-cells/), I completed the battery build with only a few unscheduled rapid electrical discharges

currently when riding, I wear a backpack with the battery inside. if the battery catches fire, it's easier to drop the backpack than dismount a flaming bike traveling 30+ mph

the top recorded speed is 40mph, the range is theoretically 30 miles at max power, but can likely go farther at lower speeds (aka [hypermiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermiling))
